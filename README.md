𝐆𝐔𝐄𝐒𝐒 𝐓𝐇𝐄 𝐍𝐔𝐌𝐁𝐄𝐑:

𝐓𝐚𝐬𝐤: The fun and easy project "Guess the Number" is a short Java project that allows the user to guess the number generated by the computer & involves the following steps:
1. The system generates a random number from a given range, say 1 to 100.
2. The user is prompted to enter their given number in a displayed dialogue box.
3. The computer then tells if the entered number matches the guesses number or it is higher/lower than the generated number.
4. The game continues under the user guessing the number. You can also incorporate further details as:
• Limiting the number of attempts.
• Adding more rounds.
• Displaying score.
• Giving points based on the number of attempts.

Here's a detailed explanation of the code along with the expected output:

### Points Covered in the Code

1. **Imports and Initialization**:
   - `Scanner` is imported to take user input.
   - `Random` is imported to generate random numbers.
   - Variables `maxAttempts`, `maxRounds`, and `score` are initialized to set the game parameters.

2. **Game Setup**:
   - A `for` loop runs for a fixed number of rounds (`maxRounds`).

3. **Round Initialization**:
   - In each round, a random number between 1 and 100 is generated.
   - Variables `attempts` and `guessed` are initialized to track the number of attempts and whether the number has been guessed.

4. **User Interaction**:
   - The user is prompted to guess the number.
   - User's input is read and compared to the randomly generated number.
   
5. **Feedback Mechanism**:
   - If the user's guess is correct, a congratulatory message is printed, the score is updated based on the remaining attempts, and the loop breaks.
   - If the guess is too low or too high, appropriate feedback is given.

6. **End of Round**:
   - If the user exhausts all attempts without guessing the number, the correct number is revealed.

7. **End of Game**:
   - After all rounds are completed, the total score is displayed.

### How the Number is Guessed Correctly

- The user inputs a guess.
- The program compares this guess to the generated number.
- If the guess is correct, the program congratulates the user and awards points based on the remaining attempts.
- If the guess is incorrect, the program provides feedback to guide the user (whether the number is higher or lower).

### Expected Output

Assuming the user makes guesses, the output will look something like this:

```plaintext
Round 1 of 5: Guess the number between 1 and 100
Enter your guess: 50
The number is higher. Try again.
Enter your guess: 75
The number is lower. Try again.
Enter your guess: 60
The number is higher. Try again.
Enter your guess: 70
The number is lower. Try again.
Enter your guess: 65
The number is higher. Try again.
Enter your guess: 67
The number is lower. Try again.
Enter your guess: 66
Congratulations! You guessed the number in 7 attempts. You earned 4 points.

Round 2 of 5: Guess the number between 1 and 100
Enter your guess: 30
The number is higher. Try again.
Enter your guess: 50
Congratulations! You guessed the number in 2 attempts. You earned 9 points.

Round 3 of 5: Guess the number between 1 and 100
Enter your guess: 45
The number is lower. Try again.
Enter your guess: 20
The number is higher. Try again.
Enter your guess: 30
Congratulations! You guessed the number in 3 attempts. You earned 8 points.

Round 4 of 5: Guess the number between 1 and 100
Enter your guess: 10
The number is higher. Try again.
...
You've used all your attempts. The number was 58.

Round 5 of 5: Guess the number between 1 and 100
Enter your guess: 85
The number is lower. Try again.
Enter your guess: 75
Congratulations! You guessed the number in 2 attempts. You earned 9 points.

Game over! Your total score is: 30
```

The actual output will depend on the user's guesses and the random numbers generated in each round.
